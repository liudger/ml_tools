# 
# Run the tool in a python shell or shelf button by importing the module,

# 
# A more robust tool for deleting keyframes in Maya, including deleting keys on
# the current frame and which are visible in the graph editor. Alternately, delete
# selected channels.
#

# 
# Run the tool, select the options, and press the Delete Key button. Set the
# options and right click the button to create a hotkey or shelf button. If
# selected keys is unchecked, it will delete keys on the current frame regardless
# of key selection. Delete sub-frames will include keys which fall within half a
# frame of the current time. The second button operates on entire channels, and it
# will delete the channels that are selected, or all the channels on an object.
