# ml_tools

This is an updated git repository of all the tools found on [my website](http://morganloomis.com). It's provided as an alternative to downloading tools individually, if you want to stay up to date with everything.

Feel free to fork or contribute. 

## Installation

Download the most current release or clone the repository to a directory of your choice. Setting the environment variable `MAYA_MODULE_PATH` is the easiest way to integrate the tools into Maya. You can put the path to ml_tools either in the Maya.env file or set it prior to launching Maya via shell.


### Windows:
```
set "MAYA_MODULE_PATH=%MAYA_MODULE_PATH%;/path/to/ml_tools"
```
### Linux / macOS:
```
export MAYA_MODULE_PATH=$MAYA_MODULE_PATH:/path/to/ml_tools
```
